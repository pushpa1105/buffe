Hey, I am Pushpa, a die hard otaku.

Core team of {Keela}<br>

Embarking on new challenges and conceiving outlandish ideas, I am a maniac <br>
Nothing is impossible, as long as you dare to dream and pursue it with unwavering passion.

You can find my [full projects list here](/projects).

Apart from programming, I find great pleasure in reading novels and indulging in various cuisines. My all-time favorite food is BuffMomo, accompanied by a sweet lassi.

Currently, I reside in Kathmandu, Nepal. If you happen to be in the vicinity, feel free to contact me; we could arrange a meal together.
